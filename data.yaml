  Roll
  Chat message
    show number of successes (any dice < 4)
    remove number of success = difficulty
      user chooses if there are more successes than difficulty [chat input]
    (optional) FAILING FORWARD, If successes were rolled before being removed due to difficulty = a success with a cost, a partial success, or success with a complication
    any successes remaining = succeed
    any remaining successes that are 6+ = each can be used to activate a special (show specials?)
    (optional) CRITICAL FAIL = no successes and at least one of the dice is a 1

Would be nice if you could track collected disadvantages and advantages with their context on the character and NPC sheets
